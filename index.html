					<p class="article">
Imagination Zoo is owned by The Royal Zoological Society of Imagination (RZSI). The Society was founded in March 1920, and the Zoo opened in July 1930. 
<br>
<br>
Apart from getting close to over 1,000 rare and endangered animals, there are many different ways to enjoy your day out. 
<br>
<br>
You can experience a busy programme of educational events and activities - ranging from keeper talks through to hands-on animal encounters - and a wide-range of eating experiences, several play areas and a fantastic gift shop. 
<br>
<br>
Imagination Zoo is one of Imaginaria’s leading centres of conservation, education and research. We work collectively with many other zoos and conservation agencies in the UK, Europe and around the world in co-ordinated conservation programmes, to help ensure the survival of many threatened animal species. We support various conservation projects in the wild through funding and expertise.

						Charlie, our oldest cheetah, turns 10 years old! <br>
						If ever an animal was born to run, it’s the cheetah. People have marvelled at this fastest of land mammals for thousands of years. Egyptian tombs and rock temples show representations of the cheetah, and many ancient cultures used the cheetah for its hunting prowess, much the way falcons are used in many countries to accompany hunters. The cheetah has adorned the courts of kings, queens, and emperors, and its amazing grace and beauty still captive the world today.

						Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but there's more to wild swine (also known as pigs, hogs, and boars) than meets the eye! From the petite pygmy hog to the immense Eurasian wild pig, swine are fascinating animals. Each species has its own distinctive look, behaviour, and geographic region but shares many traits: strength, resourcefulness, and intelligence.

					<p class="preview">
						Macaws are king-sized members of the parrot family and have typical parrot features. Their large, strong, curved beaks are designed to crush nuts and seeds. Their strong, agile toes are used like hands to grasp things. Loud, screeching and squawking voices help make their presence known in dense rain forests. They are also famous for their bright colours, which seem bold and conspicuous to us but actually blend in well with the green leaves, red and yellow fruits, and bluish shadows of the forest homes.
