						Imagination Zoo is owned by The Royal Zoological Society of Imagination (RZSI). The Society was founded in March 1920, and the Zoo opened in July 1930. 
<br>
<br>
Apart from getting close to over 1,000 rare and endangered animals, there are many different ways to enjoy your day out. 
<br>
<br>
You can experience a busy programme of educational events and activities - ranging from keeper talks through to hands-on animal encounters - and a wide-range of eating experiences, several play areas and a fantastic gift shop.
						<br>
						<br>
Imagination Zoo is one of Imaginaria’s leading centres of conservation, education and research. We work collectively with many other zoos and conservation agencies in the UK, Europe and around the world in co-ordinated conservation programmes, to help ensure the survival of many threatened animal species. We support various conservation projects in the wild through funding and expertise. 
<br>
<br>
Our extensive education programme aims to raise awareness and understanding of the fragility of life on this planet, and our responsibility to help care for it. 
<br>
<br>
We also support a range of targeted research projects which are designed to enhance our understanding of animals' behavioural and physiological needs, with many useful consequences for conservation in the wild.
<br>
<br>
Imagination Zoo’s award winning Education Department offers a variety of discovery opportunities for many different types of groups and parties. Amongst others, the Zoo holds the Learning Outside the Classroom Quality Badge. All sessions are curriculum linked and all are designed to best engage all age groups.
<br>
<br>
Our world-class Imagination Centre delivers fantastic food in a 300 seat all-day restaurant overlooking a Himalayan themed snow leopard enclosure and shopping in the Bazaar. It also plays host to conference facilities in Windows on the Wild. We also have several other eateries on site, including the Imagination Fish Bar, the Dome and indoor picnic facilities in Cockatoo Café.
<br>
<br>
Through funding provided by the zoo’s Partners for Wildlife, Living Northwest, Wildlife Survival Fund, and the contributions of zoo members and donors, the zoo is supporting conservation of wildlife, preserving fragile habitats, and increasing public awareness for wildlife and environmental issues. The zoo currently collaborates with 37 field conservation projects taking place in the Pacific Northwest and around the world. These include some of the smallest life forms—the endangered Oregon silverspot butterfly—to the largest mammals on land—the African elephant.
